      "As a Software Developer Intern at Zomato, I had the privilege of collaborating with a dynamic 50+ member tech team within the Hyperpure division. Our collective effort resulted in the development of a chatbot flow analysis tool, which significantly enhanced chat support efficiency, leading to a remarkable 30 percent increase in productivity at the production level. In addition to this, I undertook the management of various critical AWS tasks, including CI/CD, ECS, and EC2, and successfully implemented transformative upgrades like a coupon generator. These improvements not only streamlined daily operations but also drove a substantial 25 percent boost in acquisitions, benefiting both the technical and sales teams. Moreover, I took the lead in spearheading a LinkedIn activation campaign and effectively managed an advertising initiative. This strategic approach led to a notable surge in Hyperpure platform sign-ups and a substantial 20 percent increase in the onboarding process, underscoring my ability to drive user engagement and business growth.",
